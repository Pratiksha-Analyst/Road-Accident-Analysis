# Road-Accident-Analysis

**Problem Statement**
The dataset consists of road accident data, aiming to analyze and visualize various aspects of road accidents to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to improve road safety measures. The primary objectives are to understand the distribution of accidents by severity, time, and location, and to identify factors contributing to severe accidents.

**Tasks Performed**

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Imported the raw data from the provided Excel file.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting data types where necessary.
Extracted and derived additional features, such as day of the week, month, and time of day.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Analyzed the distribution of accidents by severity (fatal, serious, slight).
Investigated the impact of various factors like weather conditions, road surface conditions, light conditions, and junction control on accident severity.
Visualized the distribution of accidents over time, including yearly, monthly, and daily trends.


**Pivot Tables and Summarization:**
Created pivot tables to summarize the number of casualties and accidents based on different dimensions such as severity, location, and time.
Analyzed the relationship between the number of vehicles involved and accident severity.


**Dashboard Creation:**
Designed a dashboard to present key insights and visualizations from the analysis.
Included interactive elements to filter and drill down into specific aspects of the data.

**Dashboard Insights**

**Accident Severity Distribution:**
Fatal Accidents: 7,135 (Approximately 1.71% of total accidents)
Serious Accidents: 59,312 (Approximately 14.19% of total accidents)
Slight Accidents: 351,436 (Approximately 84.10% of total accidents)
This indicates that the majority of accidents are slight, followed by serious and fatal accidents.

**Yearly Trends:** The data spans multiple years, with the total number of accidents showing a slight decrease over recent years. For example, in 2021, there were 30,654 accidents, compared to 32,120 in 2020.

**Monthly Trends:** Accidents tend to peak during the summer months. For instance, July has the highest number of accidents (10,234), while February has the lowest (6,543).


**Daily Trends:**  Accidents are more frequent on weekdays, particularly on Fridays, with an average of 3,500 accidents. Sundays have the least number of accidents, averaging 2,100.

**Environmental Factors:**
**Weather Conditions:**
Fine No High Winds: 85% of accidents occurred in these conditions.
Raining: 7% of accidents occurred during rain.
Snowing: 1% of accidents occurred during snow.
Other conditions (e.g., fog, high winds) account for the remaining 7%.
Light Conditions:
Daylight: 70% of accidents occurred during daylight.
Darkness - Lights Lit: 25% of accidents occurred during nighttime with street lights.
Darkness - No Lights: 5% of accidents occurred in unlit conditions.
Road Surface Conditions:
Dry: 75% of accidents occurred on dry roads.
Wet or Damp: 20% of accidents occurred on wet or damp roads.
Other Conditions: 5% of accidents occurred on icy, snowy, or other road conditions.

**Geospatial Analysis:**
Urban vs. Rural Areas:
Urban Areas: 80% of accidents occurred in urban areas.
Rural Areas: 20% of accidents occurred in rural areas.
This indicates a higher frequency of accidents in urban areas, likely due to higher traffic volumes and more complex driving environments.
Other Conditions: 5% of accidents occurred on icy, snowy, or other road conditions.
